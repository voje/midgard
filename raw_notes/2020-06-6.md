# Midgard
A raspberry kubernetes home project.   
Kubernetes: k3s.   
Hardware:   
* 2x rpi B
* rpi B+
* cheap tp-link router (provides Wifi access for the RPIs)

## Raw timeline notes

### Preparing the RPIs

I got excited about this project when I saw this video:   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IafVCHkJbtI&t=2039s   
I want a Minecraft server on a raspberry k3s too!   
Also this is a great exercise for managing a cluster.   

Let's get to it...

I've built a simple rack for my 3 RPIs and wired them up to the wireless router.   
First of all, we want static IPs and sensible hostnames:
```
192.168.0.21 loki
192.168.0.22 freyr
192.168.0.23 odin
```
(Avengers ruined Thor for me; Freyr will do.)

Useful for setting up a static IP (`/etc/netplan/`):   
```yml
# network configuration capabilities, write a file
# /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg with the following:
# network: {config: disabled}
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        eth0:
            dhcp4: false
            addresses:
                - 192.168.0.23/24
            gateway4: 192.168.0.1
            nameservers:
                addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]

```

### Installing k3s
Following Rancher's k3s quickstart:   
https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/

Installing the server on `odin`.   
```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
k3s kubectl get nodes
WARN[2020-06-06T14:31:24.032996884Z] Unable to read /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml, please start server with --write-kubeconfig-mode to modify kube config permissions 
error: error loading config file "/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml": open /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml: permission denied
```

Stopping k3s as a service, starting manually with -v 3 (log level), to see what's going on.   
```bash
sudo systemctl stop k3s
k3s server -v 3

...

INFO[2020-06-06T14:44:05.264786240Z] k3s is up and running                        
ERRO[2020-06-06T14:44:05.265807271Z] Failed to find memory cgroup, you may need to add "cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory" to your linux cmdline (/boot/cmdline.txt on a Raspberry Pi) 
FATA[2020-06-06T14:44:05.266459921Z] failed to find memory cgroup, you may need to add "cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory" to your linux cmdline (/boot/cmdline.txt on a Raspberry Pi) 

```
Friendly log output is telling us to enable `cgroup memory` - containers do need that.   

```bash
cat /proc/cgroups 
#subsys_name	hierarchy	num_cgroups	enabled
cpuset	10	1	1
cpu	5	89	1
cpuacct	5	89	1
blkio	2	89	1
memory	0	100	0
devices	9	89	1
freezer	6	2	1
net_cls	3	1	1
perf_event	7	1	1
net_prio	3	1	1
pids	8	98	1
rdma	4	1	1
```
Yup, cgroups memory is not enabled.   
Let's change the settings and reboot.   
```bash
# doesn't work, see below
echo "cgroup_memory=1 enable_cgroup_memory" | sudo tee -a /boot/cmdline.txt
sudo reboot now
```
Didn't have the desired effect... seems the file is located at:
```
/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```
Apply again and reboot.

This setting seems to have worked:
```
ubuntu@odin:~$ cat /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt 
net.ifnames=0 dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=LABEL=writable rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait fixrtc cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory
```
Apply the above setting to all nodes and reboot.   

```
ubuntu@odin:~$ cat /proc/cgroups 
#subsys_name	hierarchy	num_cgroups	enabled
cpuset	5	24	1
cpu	7	66	1
cpuacct	7	66	1
blkio	4	66	1
memory	6	77	1
devices	9	66	1
freezer	10	25	1
net_cls	2	24	1
perf_event	8	24	1
net_prio	2	24	1
pids	3	71	1
rdma	11	1	1
```

We still need to run kubectl with sudo permissions, so let's add an alias and list our nodes:
```bash
echo "alias k='sudo k3s kubectl'" >> ~/.bash_aliases
source ~/.bashrc
k get nodes
```

### Add worker nodes
Get token
```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
```

On other nodes, run:
```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://myserver:6443 K3S_TOKEN=mynodetoken sh -
```

After a few moments, the nodes join the cluster:
```bash
k get nodes
NAME    STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
freyr   Ready    <none>   2m31s   v1.18.3+k3s1
odin    Ready    master   19m     v1.18.3+k3s1
loki    Ready    <none>   7s      v1.18.3+k3s1
```

### Running apps
We're at the exciting part! Time to run something on our cluster.   
First of all, most docker images are built for x86_64 systems, which means they won't work on ours (just try the kubernetes hello world and you'll get an 'exec format error').   

Let's find out our architecture:
```bash
ubuntu@odin:~$ uname -m
armv7l
ubuntu@odin:~$ lshw
WARNING: you should run this program as super-user.
odin                        
    description: ARMv7 Processor rev 4 (v7l)
    product: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Plus Rev 1.3
    serial: 000000000773773f
    width: 32 bits
    capabilities: smp
```

It seems we're running a 32bit ARM os.   

Ok so we're installing prometheus and grafana for x86.   
We need to manually build the project for x86, also there's problems with permissions on our cluster so just run everything as `root` for this test. We'll figure it out later.   

So after running the monitoring stack, 'odin' ran out of memory. Annoying and we can't keep him up long enough to delete the resources in k3s, so let's try reinstalling the cluster (I'm getting the feeling this will happen often).   

Rancher has provided us some useful scripts:
```
/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
/usr/local/bin/k3s-agent-uninstall.sh
```
